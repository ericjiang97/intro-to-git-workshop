# Tech Talks for Hackamon 2018

These are the Slide Decks for Tech Talk/Workshops for Hackamon 2018.

There is planned for 2 parts/sessions during the talk

Track 1: Gitting Started

Track 2: Firebase with Create-React-App

## Track 2 Notes

For track 2, you will need to install node.

If you are using Bash on Windows, Linux or macOS, suggest install via [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

If working on Windows, I suggest either:

* Activate Ubuntu subkernel feature (Windows 10 only)
* or, install with https://git-scm.com/ (comes together with Git and Bash)

## Prereqs

* NodeJS
* Yarn (preferably)
* An IDE (I use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
